## About Flames

Flames is a Discord bot developed by Several Circles, initially released in early 2021. Flames uses Google's Natural Language Analysis API to understand the enviornment its in.

As you talk, you'll be given a numerical score called a Flames Score based on how positive the messages you send are. Uplifting, excited, and happy messages cause your score to increase, while upset, mad, and otherwise negative messages cause your score to decrease.

Your score determines your rank. The highest scores in comparison to the global average can achieve the Platinum Summit rank, the highest honor Flames has to offer.
