# Bigger and Brighter: Introducing Flames 2

## Introducing Flames 2

Faster, easier, and safer: Flames is back.

The Flames 1 was fine; It did it's job well enough.

Unfortunately, it was incredibly slow and unstable. The code it ran on was an absolute mess, and it got to the point where Flames was just a mysterious black box that nobody really understood, not even the developers. 

So, we pitched it into the trash and started from scratch in Java instead of node.js, allowing us much more freedom in development and organizational power.

And now, after months in development, Flames 2 is here.

## Important Information

{% hint style="warning" %}
Due to the sheer difference in the codebase between the old version and new version, Flames data from Flames 1 could not be transferred to the new version. If you're already running Flames in your server, it should be safe to continue doing so, but keep in mind that any data created before August 2021 was not preserved.

Additionally, serveral features present in Flames 3 are not currently planned for re-implementation in the new version. Several others are planned, but have yet to be implemented.

**Flames 3 is alpha software, meaning it is feature-incomplete. It's offered as-is, without warranty of any kind, including warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, to the extent permitted by law. Do not use Flames in a production enviornment.**

## **Changes between Flames 1 and Flames 2**

### Flames Cares like You Care

We understand that not everybody wants to participate in Flames.

Introducing Consent, a new system which puts the control back into your hands.

Starting with Flames 2, we'll ask you before ever processing any of your data. And if you say no, we won't bug you about it again.

For those unsure about how exactly we use your data, we now have a privacy policy, so you can be sure your data will be safe with us.



### User Data that Just Makes Sense

#### Levels, experience, and stats.

More depth has been added to the scoring system in the form of an experience system. For more information about this new system, check out the article linked below.

#### Gamer Points and Multipliers

In favor of the new levelling system, Gamer Points and Multipliers will not be making a return in Flames 2. See the article linked above for more information.

#### Ranks

Gone are the old letter-grade percentile ranks, and here to stay are the new, more competitive ranks. Check out the page below to learn more about them.

#### Average Sentiment

The old Average Sentiment system is gone, and in it's place is Emotion, a cumulative score of your message scores, before they are affected by your stats. Other than how it's calculated, it works mostly the same way, although it's currently planned to be used for much more.

### The Flame Grows Ever Brighter

With this new version of Flames, we have a much greater ability to keep new features coming and everything running smoothly.
