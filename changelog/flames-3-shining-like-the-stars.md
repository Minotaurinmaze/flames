# Flames 3: Shining Like the Stars

## Flames 3.0

### It's the JDA for Me

Flames has transitioned once again to a brand new library. Starting with Flames 3, it'll be using JDA instead of discord4j. This allows us to bring you a better Flames much easier than before. See below for examples of ways this has already improved Flames.

### Slash Commands are Real

Did you know the orignal purpose of Flames was just to test out the new Slash Commands? Well, they were new at the time, but I digress.

That original idea finally sees implementation, with the transition from discord4j to JDA comes Slash Commands, and a whole new way of using Flames.



## Flames 3.1

### Buttons!

Now, Flames is even easier to use than before with the addition of buttons. Shown below various pieces of information, like your User Data, will be buttons that will display additional information or take related action.

## Flames 3.2

### Welcome Back to Flames, Welcome Back to Flames!

Daily Bonuses are back! And now, you can say goodbye to getting a DM from Flames every day, as now Daily Bonuses are recieved through a command, and the Welcome Back message is displayed wherever you ran the command.

Along with it's return is some small improvements that make the experience overall much better.

## Flames 3.3

### User Data, the way it probably always should have worked.

Check out the tabs below for more information about the improvements to User Data.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Summary" %}
More options are now available to explore within the `/mydata` command.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Flames Updates and User Data Management" %}
Flames will now automatically update your user data if something doesn't look right, instead of it having to be done manually or else your data just breaks.

You can also manually trigger an update using the new **Manage User Data** option if something isn't working correctly.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Fun Facts" %}
Isn't the whole point of Flames to learn totally pointless facts about yourself? That's exactly what Fun Facts are for! You can now see a variety of important statistics like what your worst day ever was, or how many times you've mentioned french toast. No, seriously, have a look for yourself.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### We've got your back.

The new `/debug` and `/help` commands are great ways to get help regarding Flames. If you ever run into trouble, give them a shot!

### Flames 3.3.1

A new update will be made available shortly to Flames. See the table below for information.
