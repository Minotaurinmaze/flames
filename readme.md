## Just want to get started with Flames?
Check out our [user documentation](https://flames.severalcircles.com)! It'll walk you through getting started.

## Here to help out?
We love that! An apology in advance, as currently Flames is a collage of old and new code, and it's wacky inconsistent. You are absolutely welcome to help us clean up, if you'd like!

Code documentation is still under development, so while you are still welcome to contribute, you will kind of be on your own for the time being.
