# Scoring

To this day, the Flames Score remains the central mechanic running the rest of Flames. So much of it relies heavily on this single number.

## Calculating Scores

### Message Score \(MS\)

Message scores are where the entire chain starts. This is the invisible number generated by Flames each time a message is sent that gets fed into the rest of the system. Its calculated as follows:

$$
(10S)(10M)
$$

Where S is the sentiment score \(is the sentiment positive or negative?\) returned by Google's API, and M is the magnitude \(how strong is the sentiment?\).

### Flames Score \(FS\)

The value from the MS is then run through the users stats. The equation for this depends on whether the MS is positive or negative.

Positive MS:

$$
mp
$$

Where m is the MS and p is the user's Power stat.

Negative MS:

$$
m/r
$$

Where m is the MS and r is the user's Resistance stat.
